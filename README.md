### Division of Work
Connor completed the majority of the state machine in the controller. 

Sydney created the header files, server-client connections, and error handling.

Both worked on creating the state machine diagram, debugging and testing the program.

## Status
The program meets the assignment specifications and does all error handling surrounding the client-server connections.

## Known Issues
There are no known issues with the program.

## Expected Grade
We expect to receive a high grade as we implemented the state machine which was required for an A+ grade and the program performs all the specified tasks without producing errors.
